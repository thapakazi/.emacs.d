** Recovering my broken blog gen
   As time passed by, I was left with my broken emacs
   configs. [[https://github.com/bnaysakya][bnaysakya]] was asking me to push my configs, sadly it was
   not that easy, until I had this idea to re-do my configs once again
   from scratch. By scratch, I mean from fresh emacs setup, I used to
   compile it earlier, that how it all started to crash.

   Today I am here, using this [[https://hub.docker.com/r/jare/emacs/builds/][ubuntu:emacs from jare]] and able to get
   my configs back. No longer are the worries of stale configs and
   broken setup. Yes, I am composing this small post from a random
   container ~bff6ea8dc91c~
   
   If you are wondering how I got this far, here are my steps...anyone
   can reproduce it with ease:
   - clone [[https://github.com/thapakazi/.emacs.d/tree/re_iterate][my configs :re_iterate branch]] 
   - start your container: I am heavily depending on [[https://hub.docker.com/r/jare/emacs/builds/][jare's container]]

     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
emacs_me(){
    EMACS_I_WANT_TO_USE=${EMACS_DOCKER_IMAGE:-jare/emacs}
    BLOG_CONTENTS_INSIDE_EMACS=/home/emacs/blog_contents/
    docker run -ti --rm \
	   --name $(echo ${EMACS_I_WANT_TO_USE}|shasum |cut -d' ' -f1) \
	   -e HUGO_CONTENT_PROJECT_DIR=$BLOG_CONTENTS_INSIDE_EMACS/ \
           -e DISPLAY="unix$DISPLAY"\
           -e UNAME="emacser"\
           -e GNAME="emacsers"\
           -e UID="1000"\
           -e GID="1000"\
	   -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro \
           -v ~/.emacs.docker:/home/emacs/.emacs.d \
           -v ~/.gitconfig:/home/emacs/.gitconfig \
	   -v $MY_HUGO_CONTENT_PROJECT_DIR:$BLOG_CONTENTS_INSIDE_EMACS \
	   "$EMACS_I_WANT_TO_USE" emacs ${DEBUG_FLAG}
}
     #+END_SRC
   - export your hugo project dir, where your markdown resides
     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
export HUGO_CONTENT_PROJECT_DIR=/path_to_my/hugo/markdown_files/content/
     #+END_SRC
   - start your function
     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
export EMACS_DOCKER_IMAGE=jare/emacs:latest DEBUG_FLAG='--debug-init'; emacs_me
     #+END_SRC

     I am assuming you have few things here:
     - you have played with docker earlier, good internet bandwidth
     - you know how to modify the ~emacs_me~ script above
     - you know the debug [[https://github.com/JAremko/docker-emacs#gnulinux][steps]]
     - yes, you are in linux machine ;) else good luck figuring out the
       way to share you X resource


** History of it all
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   my old posts, where I found hugo and learnt to glue it with org-mode.
   #+END_QUOTE


  Before ~hugo~ i was like:
  - days spent saying "I will blog soon"
  - since org mode is soo adivtive, I need to find sth that floats
    with it
  - [[http://rhoit.com][@rhoit]] dai started making [[https://github.com/rhoit/bekar-static-gen][bekar-static-gen]], but i no nothing about
    html/css stuffs, so i stay in shadow
  - again after month, I started publishing org to html, it was ok,
    but I guessed I couldn't scale, so again stopped
  - again, found a [[http://yagnesh.org/2015/02/19/elisp_wrapper_for_tinkerer.html][emacs guy]] using [[http://www.tinkerer.me/][tikerer]] to publish his blog; got
    exicited ðŸ˜ƒ and started tinkerering myself. It was
    like :feelsgoodman: feeling. But static stuffs broke, and I felt
    ðŸ˜ž again... still was pushing some orgs... reached upto 3 posts
    and kinda stopped.
  - then ~HUGO~ happened... Not sure, but its what I was looking
    for... I was having +ve intutions. [[https://github.com/gilesp/vurtcouk/issues/1][#few stories]] 
    
    After few hrs, i tried this [[http://www.holgerschurig.de/en/emacs-blog-from-org-to-hugo/][blog]]. And here I am, semi-ready to
    publish this post ðŸ˜¥.

  - few helps from hugo, making the [[https://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/#hosting-personal-organization-pages][org2blog2github]] workflow easier.

    Thanks to all for sharing your knowledge on this thing called
    internet and obviously the makers of HUGO. ðŸ¤—

    is copied blindly from [[http://www.holgerschurig.de/en/emacs-blog-from-org-to-hugo/][Holger Schurig's Blog]]. â˜• for him.
